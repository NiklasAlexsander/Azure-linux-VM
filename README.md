# Welcome to my terraform VM repository!


### Two versions included!
I have added two "solutions" on how to create a vm with terraform. They are quite alike but the one in the folder 'key-access' does not need a password to log in to the VM HOWEVER it needs a ssh-key-pair and a username to be able to access. This is more explained in the 'README.md' included in the folder 'key-access'.

The other solution contains a VM which needs a username and a password to grant access. This solution is located inside the 'no-pass'-folder.
